IBM Cloud Agentic AI
Audio Signal Processing Assistant Agent
ðŸ”§ Project Overview
This project implements an intelligent Audio Signal Processing Assistant Agent to assist engineers, students, and hobbyists in designing and debugging audio circuits such as preamplifiers, filters, and amplifiers. The assistant leverages IBM Cloud Lite services and the IBM Granite AI model to provide expert guidance, troubleshooting support, and design recommendations.
