# IBM_Cloud_Agentic_AI

Audio Signal Processing Assistant Agent
Project Overview
This project implements an intelligent Audio Signal Processing Assistant Agent designed to help engineers, hobbyists, and students in designing and debugging audio circuits such as preamplifiers, filters, and amplifiers. The agent can provide troubleshooting advice, filter design suggestions, and noise reduction techniques by leveraging IBM Cloud Lite services and the IBM Granite AI model.

Features
Natural language Q&A focused on audio circuitry issues.

Step-by-step troubleshooting for noise, distortion, grounding, and filter problems.

Recommendations for circuit improvements and filter designs.
User-friendly web interface for real-time interaction.

Integration with IBM Granite AI for conversational intelligence.

Cloud deployment on IBM Cloud Lite for scalable and reliable access.

Technologies Used
IBM Cloud Lite (API hosting, cloud functions)

IBM Granite AI Model (Natural Language Processing and Generation)

Python (Flask/FastAPI backend server)

Frontend: ReactJS / VueJS (or other web UI libraries)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for integrating curated technical content
